## Overview

| Device | Qty | |
|:------|:--:|-|
| NVIDIA Jetson Nano Devkit 4gb | 3 | |
| NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX Devkit  | 2 | |
| Waveshare JetBot | 1 | |
| NVIDIA Jetson Mate | 1 | |

## Requirements
PC/Mac with SD card reader

* Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor
  * NVIDIA Jetson Nano has HDMI and DisplayPort (which blows my mind)
  * Keyboard/Mouse are USB
* Network Switch (> 5-port)
* Network Cables (5+)
* PowerStrip (enough capacity for your USB Power Supplies)

* NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit (4GB)
Which also requires
  * microSD card (32GB)
  * 5v power supply with microUSB cable
  * fan cooler (optional)

This is what I consider "essential" and the prices I paid (Spring 2021).  I won't provide links to (all) the retailers as the URLs are literally several lines long.
I decided that the barrel adapter was the better option.  I will leave the USB power adapter in this list as they are approximately the same price.
