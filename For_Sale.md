# For Sale - NVIDIA Jetson Gear

I find the NVIDIA ecosystem a bit quirky and I don't have the time/energy to devote to this.

I am not that apt to break up the "kit".  However, I  would/will sell the 2 x Nano and Case as a set, separate from the NX or the Mate Cluster.

(*) The Mate Cluster is a 4-slot system (1 x "master", 3 "worker") and the "master" slot is not working.  I have run 1 x Nano and 2 x Xavier NX in the 3-slots and it works fine.  You need a +90w USB-C power supply though.
