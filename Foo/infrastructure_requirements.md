# Infrastructure Requirements

## DHCP
I use static addresses (via DHCP) for my gear.

## DNS
Not a requirement, I suppose, more of a recommendation - use some fashion of DNS for your environment. (I also have static IPs assigned to my Nanos via DHCP..

I use Red Hat Identity Management in my Lab for DNS (and other things).
