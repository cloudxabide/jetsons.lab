# install CentOS-9 Jetson Nano-2g.md

## Goal/Purpose
*hopefully* this doc will detail how to install CentOS 9 Stream on to an Nvidia Jetson Nano 2g.

-- Disclaimer:  I work at Red Hat.  That said, I am *not* an engineer, or part of a business unit that does engineering/development - but.. I *do* have access to those folks.  My point?  I probably will not figure this out on my own and I have some advantages while figuring this out that other folks may not have.

## What you need (physical)
* laptop  
* SD Card
* SD Card reader
* cable between laptop and Jetson Nano (USB-A to microUSB, in my case)
* Power supply for Nano 

## What you need (software)
* [CentOS 9 Stream](https://centos.org/)
