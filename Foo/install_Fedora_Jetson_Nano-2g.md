# Installing Fedora on Jetson Nano 2Gig 

## Status
Almost ZERO progress on this.  Not sure it's worth the squeeze.  We shall see.

## Goal
I am installing Fedora on my Jetson Nano(s) in order to run [Microshift](https://github.com/redhat-et/microshift) to test out some Edge Kubernetes (then possibly some edge ML).
